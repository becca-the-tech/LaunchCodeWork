# LaunchCodeWork

This is a repository of examples from my LaunchCode textbook that I've modified for practice, or just followed along with the textbook.
I created it mostly so I can gain practical experience using GitHub and version control software routinely and solve any problems that arise.
Also that way I can share some of my work when I'm happy with my modifications.

Plus I just want to keep my LaunchCode work separate from my more experienced or independent projects that I hope to add in some day.
